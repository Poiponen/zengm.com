<p>Football GM is a completely free sports management simulation game. You are the general manager of a football team, tasked with building your roster to compete for a championship while managing your finances. As of now, your goal can be whatever you want: winning the most championships, making the most profit, developing players from rookies to stars, etc. You can make an unlimited number of different leagues from <a href="https://play.football-gm.com/">the dashboard</a>, each one with a different set of random players.</p>
<h3>User Interface</h3>
<p>From within a league, the most important user interface element is the Play Menu, which you can access with the big green Play button at the top of the screen. Any context-dependent action, like playing a game or moving from one phase to another, is done from the Play Menu. Everything else about the user interface should (hopefully) be self-explanitory.</p>
<h3>Gameplay Overview</h3>
<p>Each season of the game is divided into several phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Preseason.</b> Players develop/age (<i>i.e.</i> their ratings change). Young players tend to get better, old players tend to get worse.</li>
<li><b>Regular season.</b> Regular season games are played, at the pace you choose through the Play menu.</li>
<li><b>Playoffs.</b> Teams that made the playoffs progress through the bracket until a champion emerges.</li>
<li><b>Draft.</b> Similar to the NFL draft - other than a lottery for the first three picks of the first round, teams are ordered from worst to best for two rounds.</li>
<li><b>Re-sign players.</b> Before free agency starts, you get the opportunity to re-sign your players with expiring contracts. Some players may refuse to re-sign, based on your team success, facilities spending, city size, and difficulty.</li>
<li><b>Free agency.</b> Players who are not re-signed become free agents and teams can sign them.</li>
</ul>
<h3>League Rules</h3>
<p>League rules are generally similar on the NFL, but simplified.</p>
<p>You can customize many of the league rules by going to Tools > God Mode within a league.</p>
<h4>Salary cap</h4>
<p>The salary cap is $200 million. This is a hard cap, meaning that if you are over the salary cap, you cannot sign any more players. However, to make it so you don't get yourself stuck without a full roster, you are always allowed to sign free agents to minimum contracts ($500k)</p>
<p>There is also a minimum salary limit of $150 million. If you are below this limit, then you have to pay a penalty equal to the difference between your payroll and the limit.</p>
<h4>Contracts</h4>
<p>The maximum contract amount is $30 million per year and the maximum contract length is 5 years.</p>
<p>The minimum contract amount is $500 thousand per year and the minimum contract length is 1 year (or, until the end of the season, if the season is already in progress).</p>
<p>When a contract expires, you have the opportunity to negotiate a new contract with the player. If you don't come to an agreement, the player becomes a free agent. This is important because, based on the salary cap rules, you can go over the cap to re-sign your own players but you can't go over the cap to sign a free agent.</p>
<p>Rookie contracts are not guaranteed until the regular season starts. That means if you release them (from the Roster page) before the regular season, you don't have to pay their contract. For all other players, contracts are fully guaranteed, and a contract still counts against your budget and your salary cap even after releasing a player.</p>
<h3>Player Ratings</h3>
<p>Player ratings are grouped into several different categories: physical, passing, rushing/receiving, blocking, defense, and kicking. Depending on a player's position, different ratings are more or less important.</p>
<p>Ratings are on a scale from 0-100. The whole scale is used, so a typical value for a rating is 50. Roughly, the overall ("ovr") player rating means:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>90+:</b> All-time great</li>
<li><b>80+:</b> MVP candidate</li>
<li><b>60+:</b> All League candidate</li>
<li><b>50+:</b> Starter</li>
<li><b>40+:</b> Backup and special teams</li>
<li><b>lower:</b> Bad player</li>
</ul>
<p>The potential ("pot") rating is also important. This is an estimate of the player's future overall rating. Just like in real life, most players never reach their potential, but some do reach it and some even exceed it. (Potential is calculated by simulating career arcs for a player and picking the 75th percentile ovr, so ignoring the noise caused from small sample size, a player should exceed his pot 25% of the time.)</p>
<p>Also, you might notice that the height ("hgt") rating is not always proportional to the height in feet/inches of a player, because the hgt rating also includes wingspan and standing reach - basically how much a player's height/length impacts the game. The hgt rating is what's used in the simulations. The heights in feet/inches are just for show.</p>
<p>The displayed ratings are not the real ratings. They are estimates from your scouts. Increase the scouting budget to see more accurate ratings. This is a gradual effect over 3 seasons; you don't instantly see more accurate ratings by increasing spending.</p>
<p>Finally, little symbols you see next to a player's name like <span class="skills-alone"><span class="skill" title="Accurate Passer">Pa</span><span class="skill" title="Deep Passer">Pd</span><span class="skill" title="Smart Passer">Ps</span><span class="skill" title="Athletic">A</span><span class="skill" title="Explosive Runner">X</span><span class="skill" title="Hands">H</span><span class="skill" title="Pass Blocker">Bp</span><span class="skill" title="Run Blocker">Br</span><span class="skill" title="Pass Rusher">PR</span><span class="skill" title="Run Stopper">RS</span><span class="skill" title="Lockdown Coverage">L</span></span> represent the key skills a player has. This is designed so that you can just glance at a player and easily take in that information. It has no impact on gameplay. A player who barely misses getting a symbol will be about the same as a player who barely gets it.</p>
<p>To see what a symbol means, hover your mouse over it or consult this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pa: Accurate Passer</li>
<li>Pd: Deep Passer</li>
<li>Ps: Smart Passer</li>
<li>A: Athletic</li>
<li>X: Explosive Runner</li>
<li>H: Hands</li>
<li>Bp: Pass Blocker</li>
<li>Br: Run Blocker</li>
<li>PR: Pass Rusher</li>
<li>RS: Run Stopper</li>
<li>L: Lockdown Coverage</li>
</ul>
<h3>Depth Chart</h3>
<p>Go to Team > Depth Chart to see select which players to start at every position. You can do crazy things if you want, like starting 5 kickers as your offensive line. Just don't expect that to go well! You can also auto-sort your depth chart.</p>
<p>Some extremely talented players will be good enough to contribute at multiple positions. For those players, you have to decide if that's worth the fatigue and injury risk that comes along with playing multiple positions.</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>There is no real way to "win" at Football GM. The game never ends. Your goal may be to win as many games as possible, or to make as much money as possible, or to draft a player and win him as many championships as possible, or anything else you can think of.</p>
<p>Regardless of your goal, you probably want to win some games. And there are also multiple ways to do that! Think of how NFL teams are run. Tanking is a viable strategy, but risky because your draft picks might be busts. Freeing up salary cap space to sign a big free agent can work, but if your team performance suffers too much, a star might not want to sign with you. Veterans can be available for cheap, but their abilities may decline rapidly. Ultimately, it's up to you to find the best strategy to meet your goals!</p>
<h3>Custom Rosters</h3>
<p>By default, all players are completely randomly generated. You might be able to find some custom rosters people have made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Football_GM/">on Reddit</a>. You can also make your own: <a href="/manual/customization/">click here for more info about custom rosters.</a></p>
