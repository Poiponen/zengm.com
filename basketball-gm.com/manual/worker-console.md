title: Advanced League Editing in the Worker Console
---

### What is this?

Since Basketball GM runs inside your web browser, you can edit pretty much any part of the game from within your web browser. You do this by using the JavaScript console in your browser to access the core of the game. There, you will find an API that you can use to run little scripts that edit your league.

This page explains how to access the console and shows examples of what you can do there.

### How do I access the worker console?

**Chrome:**

1. Open your league in BBGM.
2. Open a new tab, copy chrome://inspect/#workers into the address bar and hit enter.
3. Click "Inspect" under the URL similar to https://play.basketball-gm.com/gen/worker-2020.08.02.0001.js and it will pop up another window where you can run the code snippets below.

**Firefox:**

1. Open your league in BBGM.
2. Open a new tab, copy about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox into the address bar and hit enter.
3. Scroll down (maybe way down) until you see the "Shared Workers" section. There should be an entry there similar to /gen/worker-2020.08.02.0001.js.
4. Click "Inspect" next to it. That will open a new tab where you can run the code snippets below.

### Code snippets

#### Change the jersey number of a player

```
player_id_number = 150;
new_jeresy_number = "45";

p = await bbgm.idb.cache.players.get(player_id_number);
if (p.stats.length > 0) {
    p.stats[p.stats.length - 1].jerseyNumber = new_jeresy_number;
} else {
    p.jerseyNumber = new_jeresy_number;
}
await bbgm.idb.cache.players.put(p);
```

#### Buff/nerf draft prospect ratings

```
players = await bbgm.idb.cache.players.indexGetAll("playersByTid", bbgm.PLAYER.UNDRAFTED);
for (const p of players) {
    const ratings = p.ratings[p.ratings.length - 1];

    ratings.pss *= 1.2;

    // Recompute ovr and pot
    await bbgm.player.develop(p, 0);

    // Recompute player value
    await bbgm.player.updateValues

    await bbgm.idb.cache.players.put(p);
}
```

That will increase the passing rating by 20% for all draft prospects.

You can do other stuff to player ratings. These are the names of all the rating variables:

```
diq
dnk
drb
endu
fg
ft
hgt
ins
jmp
oiq
pss
reb
spd
stre
tp
```

#### "Lock ratings" for all active players

```
players = await bbgm.idb.cache.players.getAll();
for (const p of players) {
    p.ratings[p.ratings.length - 1].locked = true;
    await bbgm.idb.cache.players.put(p);
}
```

#### List all the players who have died

```
bbgm.iterate(
    bbgm.idb.league.transaction("players").store,
    undefined,
    undefined,
    player => {
        if (typeof player.diedYear === "number") {
            console.log(player.firstName + " " + player.lastName + " (" + player.born.year + " - " + player.diedYear + ")");
        }
    },
);
```

#### Change GM History teams

[On August 20, 2020](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/08/gm-history/), a feature was added to view your overall performance as a GM across multiple different past teams. But prior to this update, it did not track which teams you controlled in the past. If you remember, you may want to manually specify your past teams.

The numbers in the `value` part are team ID numbers, which you can see in URLs when you click on a team.

The numbers in the `start` part are the season when you took control of that team. The first one must be `-Infinity`, representing the team you started with in this league.

The last entry must be your current team. If you just took control of the team after controlling another team for the season and playoffs this year, then use next season for `start`.

```
const history = [
    { start: -Infinity, value: 5 },
    { start: 2025, value: 7 },
    { start: 2028, value: 9 },
];

bbgm.g.userTid = history;
await bbgm.idb.cache.gameAttributes.put({
    key: "userTid",
    value: history,
});
```
