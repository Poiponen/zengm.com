<p>The set of technologies used as a foundation for a piece of software is sometimes called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack">stack</a>. The most famous is LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python). A trendier option is MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js). And there are tons more, mostly tounge-in-cheek jokes at the absurdity of reducing a stack to a catchy acronym (at least, I hope that's what they are). There is even the <a href="http://lebron.technology/">LeBron stack</a>: LevelDB, Browserify, and npm. In <a href="http://basketball-gm.com/">Basketball GM</a>, I use npm a little and I indirectly use LevelDB through IndexedDB in Chrome, but sadly it'd be quite a stretch to say I'm using the LeBron stack.</p>
<p>What stack am I using? Nothing coherent or well established. Just a hodgepodge of things that somehow happens to work. But that's just not a catchy answer, so I set out to find a cool name for my stack. The LeBron stack is a fun name, so I figured I could try to find another NBA-inspired name.</p>

<p>Here's the strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a list of potential acronyms</li>
<li>Make a list of the technologies used in Basketball GM</li>
<li>Come up with a formula for the score and use it to find a sweet acronym</li>
</ol>
<p>For the potential acronyms, I used <a href="https://gist.github.com/dumbmatter/63cf924a696522f6677b#file-names-csv">a list of all the active or Hall of Fame NBA players</a>, first and last names treated separately.</p>
<p>For the technologies, it's a little more complicated. I tried to come up with a good one for each letter of the alphabet, but that was too difficult. I only came up with <a href="https://gist.github.com/dumbmatter/63cf924a696522f6677b#file-letters-csv">technologies for 15 letters</a>. And some of those were really stretches, so I added a score for each technology based on its relevance, from 0 (barely relevant) to 10 (absolutely critical).</p>
<p>To score the potential acronyms, I took the average of the score for each letter (-5 for letters with no corresponding technology) and applied a penalty for short acronyms (otherwise JJ would come out first, since JavaScript is a 10).</p>
<p>I applied my scoring algorithm to my list of names and was pleasantly surprised to find a pretty high scoring name at the top: HINRICH, with a score of 7.7:</p>
<style type="text/css">
.stack-acronym {<br />
  list-style-type: none;<br />
  padding-left: 0;<br />
}<br />
.stack-acronym b {<br />
  font-family: monospace;<br />
  font-size: 20px;<br />
}<br />
</style>
<ul class="stack-acronym">
<li><b>H</b>TML5</li>
<li><b>I</b>ndexedDB</li>
<li><b>N</b>oSQL</li>
<li><b>R</b>equire.jS</li>
<li><b>I</b>ndexedDB</li>
<li><b>C</b>hai</li>
<li><b>H</b>TML5</li>
</ul>
<p>And then I was absolutely shocked to see #2 on the list with a score of 7.5:</p>
<ul class="stack-acronym">
<li><b>K</b>nockout</li>
<li><b>I</b>ndexedDB</li>
<li><b>R</b>equire.js</li>
<li><b>K</b>nockout</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gev_Phjl764">Shut it down!!!!</a> My search is done.</p>
<p>Think you can do better? <a href="https://gist.github.com/dumbmatter/63cf924a696522f6677b">Here's the code and data.</a> But I think the KIRK HINRICH stack will be hard to beat.</p>
