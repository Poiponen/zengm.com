I just added a fun new feature to leagues with God Mode enabled. Now you can determine who wins a game before you sim it.

On the Live Sim page you can set the winner of any of today's games:

<!--more-->

And on the schedule page you do it for any of a team's scheduled games, including buttons at the top for bulk actions:

<img src="/files/force-win-2.png" class="img-responsive" />

Behind the scenes, this works by repeatedly simulating the game until it finds a simulation with the desired result. After 500 simulations, if the selected team has not yet won, it starts gradually tilting the scales, similar to how home court advantage works. After 1500 simulations that are gradually more and more biased towards the selected team, you're almost guaranteed to have one turn out right.
