<p>On March 18, 2015, <a href="https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2015/03/one-million-seasons/">Basketball GM passed 1 million seasons played</a>.</p>
<p>On December 28, 2015, <a href="https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2015/12/two-million-seasons/">Basketball GM passed 2 million seasons played</a>.</p>
<p>And today, we have crossed the 3 million seasons threshold!</p>
<p>Here are some interesting statistics at this milestone:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Total time played:</b> 92,478,200 minutes, which equals 1,541,303 hours or 64,221 days or <b>176 years!!</b></li>
<li><b>Average number of seasons per league:</b> 2.96 - this number is so low because a lot of leagues are abandoned before a whole season is played. Additionally, this means that we also recently crossed the 1 million leagues threshold!</li>
</ul>
