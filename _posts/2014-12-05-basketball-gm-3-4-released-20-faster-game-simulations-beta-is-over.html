<p>After a long beta (thanks for testing!), the new version of Basketball GM is ready. All your leagues will be upgraded automatically. The main difference is that <a href="http://basketball-gm.com/blog/2014/11/20-faster-game-simulation-try-the-beta-now/">game simulation is about 20% faster</a>. Additionally, there are some minor bug fixes (the NaN bug is finally gone, I think) and enhancements (real injury descriptions show in old box scores and uploading exported league files is much faster).</p>
<p>On the downside, Internet Explorer is no longer supported. If you're an IE user, you can export your leagues still. Then you have the option of switching to Chrome/Firefox or using an old version of Basketball GM. Hopefully IE support will return to the latest version eventually, but <a href="https://twitter.com/IEDevChat/status/533338659555008512">I'm not holding my breath</a>.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any problems. Post here, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2of8ll/basketball_gm_34_released_20_faster_game/">on Reddit</a>, or <a href="mailto:commissioner@basketball-gm.com">email me</a>.</p>
