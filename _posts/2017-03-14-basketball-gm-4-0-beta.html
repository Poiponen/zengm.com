<p><a href="https://beta.basketball-gm.com/">Check it out!</a></p>
<p>I'll make another post with more details later, but right now, the beta brings some good and some bad:</p>
<p>Good: Performance, performance, performance. Depending on your computer and browser, you will find it about 10 times faster. That is a lot.</p>
<p>Good: It works in Safari now, although it's not that well tested.</p>
<p>Bad: You can only open a league in one tab at a time. I do have plans to restore multi-tab play, but I didn't want to hold up the beta for it. And single-tab mode will be needed as a fallback mode in some browsers, so it will be good to test it. Please do give me feedback on this. If single-tab mode is horrible, I will prioritize multi-tab mode.</p>
<p>This is a beta, so bang on it, try to break it, try to get it to produce an error. Feedback is appreciated, on <a href="https://discord.gg/caPFuM9">Discord</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/5zgrv9/basketball_gm_40_beta/">Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>(Also, accounts don't work on the beta. They aren't supposed to. That's not a bug.)</p>
