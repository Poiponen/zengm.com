<p>As of the latest version (2015.01.31.658), you can go to Tools > Export Stats within a league and export either player average stats or individual game stats. The exported file is in CSV format, which means you can easily view it in Excel or <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">any other spreadsheet software</a> if you want to more deeply analyze the stats in one of your leagues.</p>
<p>I know it's missing a couple things now (playoff stats, team stats, shot locations, ...), but I want to make sure the core feature works well before implementing all of those.</p>
