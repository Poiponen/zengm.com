<p>Today the one millionth season of Basketball GM was played! This is incredible! So far beyond what I ever imagined possible.</p>
<p>Here are some interesting statistics at this milestone:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Total time played:</b> 37,366,469 minutes, which equals 622,774 hours or 25,949 days or <b>71 years!!</b></li>
<li><b>Highest season played to:</b> 2735 - yes, that is over 700 seasons in the same league</li>
<li><b>Average number of seasons per league:</b> 2.72 - this number is so low because a lot of leagues are abandoned before a whole season is played</li>
</ul>
<p>I started tracking the number of seasons played about 2 years ago. But I don't think it will take another 2 years to get another million seasons!</p>
