  content: You need to change the minimum salary to match also if you want it to just
    be a cosmetic change

  content: "This sounds just fine on first glance; I'm excited to see how it plays
    out.\r\n\r\nWith this change, shouldn't the moneyball achievements be adjusted
    to 1.5X as well?  So, moneyball 1 would be $60M and moneyball 2 would be $45M?
    Or, would you rather just leave them alone and thus make each one harder to achieve?"

  content: I played this game for basically all 2015 but fell off this year. Love
    the game! You can really put alot more into it and this game could really blow
    up...its already the best gm game out there by far.

<p>This applies to new leagues only. If you want to change it in existing leagues, enable God Mode (in the Tools menu).</p>
<p>Additionally, all of the financial parts of the game (like TV revenue, merchandising, etc) have been scaled up too, and they will automatically adjust as you change the salary cap. Previously they didn't change at all, so it was very difficult to run a profitable team in a league with a high salary cap, and too easy with a low salary cap.</p>
<p>Let me know if you think this has introduced any balance issues. It is supposed to just be a cosmetic change, with every dollar amount 50% higher.</p>
