Happy New Year!

2018 was a great year for Basketball GM. The game is better than ever. Well of course I'm a biased source, but it's not just me saying that. The stats speak for themselves.

{:.table}
| Year | Sessions  | Pageviews   | Total Play Time (years) |
| ---- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| 2013 | 135,664   | 13,661,063  | 18.14                   |
| 2014 | 471,553   | 39,662,532  | 42.06                   |
| 2015 | 982,926   | 76,650,999  | 66.73                   |
| 2016 | 1,101,256 | 86,009,829  | 70.09                   |
| 2017 | 1,657,749 | 144,489,273 | 86.79                   |
| 2018 | 1,868,091 | 184,571,462 | 100.70                  |

2018 set new records in all those categories! The last column is the craziest... you guys collectively spent over 100 years playing Basketball GM in 2018. In other words, at any given time, there were on average 100 people playing Basketball GM.
