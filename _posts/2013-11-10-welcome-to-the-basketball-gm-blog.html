<p>Welcome to the Basketball GM Blog! The main purpose of this blog is to write about the development of <a href="http://basketball-gm.com/">Basketball GM</a>, a free online single-player basketball management simulation game. Additionally, there will be some other basketball-related posts here from time to time, such as the two posts below this one. Those are old posts from <a href="http://www.jeremyscheff.com/">my personal blog</a> that I decided fit better here, so I moved them. Also, it's nice to start a blog with at least a little content already posted, right?</p>
