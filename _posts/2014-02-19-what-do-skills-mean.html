  content: Hey,  I like your website. But could you add Player Numbers and Retired
    Numbers. I know it's not much of a need. But it could be very useful.

  content: "I actually liked that the labels meant something.  In my head it played
    out like the player had intangibles that mad him a better player than his perceived
    skill level.  As in, Larry Bird would have tons of the labels even if some of
    his skill ratings where not off the charts.  So that makes targeting guys with
    a lower skill number but 4 or 5 labels a smart team building move.  \r\n\r\nThis
    kinda represents how a player with obvious physical skills might not necessarily
    be a good basketball player."

    what you describe would apply to old players who are still respected even after
    their abilities decline."

<p>In Basketball GM, "skills" are the little labels you see next to a player's name, like "B" for a good ball handler and "3" for a good 3 point shooter. But what do they actually do? Well, that's changed recently, so let me explain.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Originally, skills were purely cosmetic, just a quick way to glance at a player and see what he brings to the table. However, at some point, they worked their way into the game simulation code so you would get bonuses for players with certain skills. Like having multiple 3 point shooters in the game helps your offense by spreading the floor, so you'd get a bonus for that. The problem was that a player who just barely missed getting the "3" label is basically the same as a player who barely got the "3" label, so they should actually have similar effects on the game. I know, I know, this is common sense, but that's not how Basketball GM worked. But... it is now.</p>
<p>As of now, the skill labels are again purely cosmetic. There's no big difference between a player who barely makes a cutoff for a label and a player who barely misses it.</p>
