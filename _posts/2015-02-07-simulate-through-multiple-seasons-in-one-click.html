<p>New feature! Go to Tools > Auto Play Seasons and you can tell Basketball GM to simulate through any number of seasons. The AI will take over your team for you and play through multiple seasons without any user input required.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how many people will actually benefit from this feature. I mainly made it for debugging. But I hope someone appreciates it!</p>
