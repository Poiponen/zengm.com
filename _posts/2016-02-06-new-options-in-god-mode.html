<p>At the God Mode screen (accessible from the Tools menu), there are now 10 new options you can use to customize your league:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable/disable injuries</li>
<li>Numer of games per season</li>
<li>Quarter length</li>
<li>Minimum roster size</li>
<li>Salary cap</li>
<li>Minimum payroll</li>
<li>Luxury tax threshold</li>
<li>Luxury tax</li>
<li>Minimum contract</li>
<li>Maximum contract</li>
</ul>
<p>Previously these things were all impossible (or very difficult) to change.</p>
<p>The caveat is, the AI might not respond well if you change some of these values drastically, particularly the financial ones. But hopefully it's still better than nothing. Let me know how you like it!</p>
