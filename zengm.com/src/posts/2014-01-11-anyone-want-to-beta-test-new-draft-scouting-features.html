<p>Usually I'm the only one to test things before features go live, but let's try something different...</p>
<p>I'm working on adding draft scouting to the game. Basically, the game pre-generate 3 years of draft classes ahead of time so you can get more of an idea about what a high draft pick in a certain season might get you. You can view future draft classes at any time, but the further into the future, the more uncertain the ratings.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Go to <a href="http://beta.basketball-gm.com/">beta.basketball-gm.com</a> to try it (just click Players > Draft once you're inside a league). And keep in mind the following about the beta site:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can't move leagues between the normal site (<a href="http://play.basketball-gm.com/">play.basketball-gm.com</a>) and the beta site. So treat everything on the beta site as a test.</li>
<li>Things are more likely to be buggy on the beta site. So treat everything on the beta site as a test.</li>
<li>Your leagues on the beta site could stop working at any time. On the normal site, I always write upgrade code so that (ideally) no old leagues break. Might not work that way on the beta site. So treat everything on the beta site as a test.</li>
</ol>
<p>But please do try it out and give me feedback on the draft scouting (comment here, or email <a href="mailto:commissioner@basketball-gm.com">commissioner@basketball-gm.com</a>, or <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1uzyzy/anyone_want_to_beta_test_new_draft_scouting/">comment on Reddit</a>). I already have a couple ideas I want to do in the future (such as allowing players to move between draft classes, letting you promise to draft someone to encourage them to enter the draft earlier).</p>
