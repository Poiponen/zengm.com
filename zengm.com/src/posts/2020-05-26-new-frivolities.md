After you've played several years in a league, it can be fun to go to Tools > Frivolities and ask questions like "which player has the most relatives?" and "who had the longest career without ever making the playoffs?"

If you enjoy the current frivolities, then I think you're going to love the 12 new ones I just added today! All available in the same place, Tools > Frivolities, in both Basketball GM and [Football GM](https://football-gm.com/). The main frivolities page has also been redesigned, and individual frivolities now contain a menu linking to all other frivolities for easier navigation.

The new frivolities are:

<!--more-->

**Best Players Without a Ring** - The best players who never won a title.

**Best Players Without an MVP** - The best players who never won an MVP awards.

**Best Progs** - Largest single season ovr increases.

**Biggest Busts** - Top 5 picks with the worst careers.

**Biggest Steals** - Late picks (2nd round in BBGM, 5th+ round in FBGM) or undrafted players with the best careers.

**Career Earnings** - Players who made the most money.

**Hall of Good** - The best retired players who didn't make the Hall of Fame.

**Hall of Trash** - Worst players who actually got some playing time to show how bad they are. The formula for this is pretty basic - lowest career PER for players who have been in the league for at least 3 years and have played at least 500 minutes. This frivolity is not available in Football GM because it is harder to come up with a formula to find bad football players.

**Most Times Traded** - Players who were passed around like... you fill in the blank.

**Most Years on One Team** - Players who were loyal to one team for the longest.

**Oldest to Play in a Game** - The oldest players who actually played.

**Worst Injuries** - Players who experienced the largest ovr declines due to injuries.

Most of these ideas were suggested by users. If you have any more frivolities you'd like to see added, please [let me know](/contact/).

It is purely a coincidence that this is just [one day before the 1 year anniversary of the original frivolities feature](/blog/2019/05/frivolities/). I didn't even notice until I went to write this blog post!
