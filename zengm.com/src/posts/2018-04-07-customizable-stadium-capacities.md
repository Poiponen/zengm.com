Minor new feature in version 2018.04.08.66: you can now set the stadium capacity for each team. To do this, enable God Mode (Tools menu) and then go to Tools > Edit Team Info.

This will probably do weird things to team finances if you change it. You probably shouldn't edit it unless you're making a custom league file.

For people making custom league files, see [the teams customization documentation](https://basketball-gm.com/manual/customization/teams/) for more info.
