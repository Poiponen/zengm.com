<p>One of the most important parts of Basketball GM is the player development algorithm. The tricky part is that different players develop differently depending on their ages and abilities. Previously, this was handled poorly in Basketball GM. But as of today, a new player development algorithm is live and you will hopefully find it much more realistic.</p>

<p>Here's a quick list of the main improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Previously, players could make ridiculously huge improvements in one season, like going from a scrub to a star, even in their rookie seasons. This is much less common now. Instead, players tend to have more gradual improvement over several years in their teens through mid 20s. You will not see 20 year old MVPs like you used to.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously, players could completely transform as they developed. A lumbering post player could turn into Dirk. This is also much less common now. Players can still improve, but they won't change so drastically.</p></li>
<li><p>Different ratings are handled differently. Some things are easier to improve than others. Think about the NBA... there are many players who develop their jump shots or refine their post games. But there are very few who make similarly large jumps in rebounding or passing.</p></li>
<li><p>Aging is more realistic. Previously, all ratings declined roughly equally. But that doesn't make sense. You don't forget how to play the game as you get older, you mostly just lose your athleticism.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please let me know how you like these changes. It's possible that more tweaking will be needed, but hopefully not too much because I had a lot of great help from beta testers.</p>
<p>If you have any feedback, post here, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2hqitc/revamped_player_development_algorithm_finally/">on Reddit</a>, or <a href="mailto:commissioner@basketball-gm.com">email me</a>.</p>
<p>My next major task is to try out some ideas that might significantly improve performance...</p>
