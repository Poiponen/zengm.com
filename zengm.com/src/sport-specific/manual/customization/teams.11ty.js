<p>This is the simplest format to define teams in a League File:</p>
<pre>
{
  "version": 43,
  "teams": [
    {
      "tid": 0,
      "cid": 0,
      "did": 0,
      "region": "Atlanta",
      "name": "Gold Club",
      "abbrev": "ATL",
      "pop": 5.3,
      "stadiumCapacity": ${defaultStadiumCapacity}
    },
    ...
  ]
}
</pre>
<p>
	The contents of each team object is as follows. Note that imgURL is optional.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		"tid": team ID number (from 0 to N-1 so there are N teams in total, usually
		N is 30)
	</li>
	<li>"cid": conference ID number, either 0 (Eastern) or 1 (Western)</li>
	<li>
		"did": division ID number, from 0 to 5 for the Atlantic, Central, Southeast,
		Southwest, Northwest, and Pacific divisions, respectively
	</li>
	<li>"region": team region/city</li>
	<li>"name": team name</li>
	<li>
		"abbrev": team abbreviation, typically 3 upper case letters like ATL for
		Atlanta
	</li>
	<li>"pop": population of the region, in millions of people</li>
	<li>
		"stadiumCapacity": number of people who fit in the team's stadium (default
		${defaultStadiumCapacity}) - weird things might happen financially if you start tweaking this
	</li>
	<li>
		"imgURL": URL for a 120x120 image to be displayed on the roster page for a
		team (optional)
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	It is also possible to specify much more information, including results from
	past seasons and team statistics. To see how those are defined, look at an
	exported League File from one of your leagues. Also note that for values that
	can change over time (basically everything except "tid"), values are also stored
	in the "seasons" array for each team, one for each season.
</p>
<p>
	${gameName} works best with ${bySport(
			{
				basketball: "30 teams, 15 in each conference, and 5 in each division",
				football: "32 teams, 16 in each conference, and 4 in each division",
				hockey: "32 teams, 16 in each conference, and 8 in each division",
			},
			sport,
		)}. If you have more or less teams, it will still work, but generated
	schedules (and maybe some other aspects of the game) will be less balanced.
</p>

	}
};
