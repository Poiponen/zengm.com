<p>This is the simplest format to define players in a League File:</p>
<pre>

<p>Some things you might want to know:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		tid is the team ID number, ranging from 0 to N (usually 30) for the teams in
		your league. Additionally,
		<ul>
			<li>-1 is for free agents</li>
			<li>-2 is for undrafted players</li>
			<li>-3 is for retired players</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			If don't include a draft year, draft prospects will appear in the upcoming
			draft. If you want to specify multiple upcoming drafts, you need to use
			the <code>draft.year</code> property, like is done for Draft Prospect
			above. If you do this, make sure to also set
			<a href="/manual/customization/game-attributes/"
				><code>startingSeason</code></a
			>, otherwise your draft classes will shift when the default starting
			season changes each year.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you specify less than 70 prospects in a draft class, random prospects
			will be created to reach that limit.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		In the example above, there are only two players defined. If your file
		doesn't include at least 10 players on each team, then bad things will
		happen when you try to use it. You should also include a good amount of
		bad/mediocre young players beyond the 10 man limit or as free agents (maybe
		30-60 in total). Otherwise, you might end up running out of free agents
		before the free agent pool naturally fills up with undrafted prospects and
		unsigned players, and then bad things will happen.
	</li>
	<li>
		Jersey numbers can be defined at the root of the player object like
		<code>"jerseyNumber": "25",</code>. For players with stats included, use the
		same property inside a stats object to override the jersey number for a
		specific season.
	</li>
	<li>
		Ratings should be on a scale from 0 to 100 with a mean of about 50 and about
		half of the players between 35 and 65. Descriptions of rating categories:
		<ul>
			<li>
				"hgt": height, which factors into pretty much everything - this is meant
				to also reflect things like standing reach and wingspan, and it is used
				in game simulations rather than the player's "true" height in
				feet/inches. For a realistic professional basketball league, take the
				player's height in inches, subtract 66, and multiply by 3.70. Then maybe
				add or subtract a little based on wingspan. This means 0 is 5'6" and 100
				is 7'9" (with a little wiggle room for wingspan).
			</li>
			<li>
				"stre": strength, which influences defense, rebounding, and low post
				scoring
			</li>
			<li>
				"spd": speed, which influences ball handling, fast breaking, and defense
			</li>
			<li>
				"jmp": jumping, which influences finishing at the rim, rebounding,
				blocking shots, and defense
			</li>
			<li>
				"endu": endurance, which governs how fast a player's skills degrade as
				he gets tired
			</li>
			<li>"ins": low post scoring</li>
			<li>"dnk": dunking/layups</li>
			<li>"ft": free throw shooting</li>
			<li>"fg": 2 point jump shot ability</li>
			<li>"tp": 3 point shooting</li>
			<li>"oiq": offensive IQ (affects many aspects of offense)</li>
			<li>"diq": defensive IQ (affects many aspects of defense)</li>
			<li>
				"drb": dribbling (also influences passing, since you can pass easier if
				you're not worried about losing the ball)
			</li>
			<li>"pss": passing</li>
			<li>"reb": rebounding</li>
			<li>
				"pot": estimate of the player's potential future overall rating. This
				will be computed when players are imported, so there is no need to add
				it here.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		It's best not to specify additional properties in the ratings object, like
		<code>ovr</code>, <code>pot</code>, <code>pos</code>, and
		<code>skills</code>. If you simply leave them out, then they will be
		auto-generated on import.
	</li>
	<li>
		You can optionally include a URL for an image to be used instead of a
		randomly-generated face by putting "imgURL":
		"http://www.example.com/img.jpg" in the root of a player object.
	</li>
	<li>
		There are several other pieces of information you can include, maybe most
		notably stats from previous seasons. Look in an exported League File from
		one of your leagues to see what else can be added.
	</li>
</ul>
