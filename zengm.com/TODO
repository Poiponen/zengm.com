build performance
- 25 minutes
- alternatives
  - https://github.com/google/eleventy-high-performance-blog/blob/main/_includes/layouts/base.njk uses addHash
    - https://github.com/mightyplow/eleventy-plugin-cache-buster looks similar
  - check expiration in htaccess (and get rid of static.htaccess)
  - minify js files
    - eleventy transform?
  - compress images

basketball-gm.com, football-gm.com
- include .htaccess files for basketball-gm.com and football-gm.com in build
- TEST
  - dry-run deploy script
  - on bbgm deploy, skip bbgm-ads, old, and prebid folders

sidebar menu
- use eleventyNavigation?
  - could also use that to replace the hacky parent system i built...
    - show main title in <h1> everywhere, and breadcrumbs at top. except maybe blog listing?

404 pages on basketball-gm.com and football-gm.com

# later

redirect basketball-gm.com/files and football-gm.com/files

tag blog posts with sport and show icon somehow, like changelog?

eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight
- can't be used from JS template :(
