    - https://github.com/mightyplow/eleventy-plugin-cache-buster looks similar
  - check expiration in htaccess (and get rid of static.htaccess)

basketball-gm.com, football-gm.com
- include .htaccess files for basketball-gm.com and football-gm.com in build
- TEST
  - backups before
  - dry-run deploy script
  - on bbgm deploy, skip bbgm-ads, old, and prebid folders

- use eleventyNavigation?
  - could also use that to replace the hacky parent system i built...
    - show main title in <h1> everywhere, and breadcrumbs at top. except maybe blog listing?
