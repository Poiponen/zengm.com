- 25 minutes
- alternatives
  - https://github.com/google/eleventy-high-performance-blog/blob/main/_includes/layouts/base.njk uses addHash
    - https://github.com/mightyplow/eleventy-plugin-cache-buster looks similar
  - check expiration in htaccess
  - minify css/js
  - compress images

blog
- rss feed
  - test
- 301 redirect from BBGM/FBGM for blog and feed

basketball-gm.com, football-gm.com
- hacky way - i think this looks better!
  - in src, replace all basketball-gm.com URLs with /basketball/
  - post-process to replace "/basketball/ with "https://basketball-gm.com/
    - see https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-plugin-rss/blob/master/src/htmlToAbsoluteUrls.js
  - special case for feed.xml, replace "https://zengm.com/basketball/ with "https://basketball-gm.com/
  - different depending on if inside the "basketball" or "football" folders, then need to explicitly link to zengm.com
- less hacky way
  - in src, replace all basketball-gm.com URLs with /basketball/
  - custom url filter (similar to built-in https://www.11ty.dev/docs/filters/url/ )
    - depending on "sport" of current page, handle /basketball, /football, and other links
    - https://www.11ty.dev/docs/filters/url/
    - detect /football/ and /basketball/ URLs?
    - how to use in 11ty.js templates? this.url() should work, i think, see https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/javascript/ filters
- check rss feed URLs too, they are processed differently to make them absolute already

sidebar menu
- use eleventyNavigation?
  - could also use that to replace the hacky parent system i built...
    - show main title in <h1> everywhere, and breadcrumbs at top. except maybe blog listing?

multiple sites
- https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/662
- https://www.11ty.dev/docs/pages-from-data/
  - data could just be the names of the sports, then whatever template language i use could do if/else inline
- or, use JS templates and write bySport/isSport equivalents

redirect basketball-gm.com/files and football-gm.com/files

# later

tag blog posts with sport and show icon somehow, like changelog?

eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight
- can't be used from JS template :(
