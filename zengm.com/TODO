build performance

blog
- links to /files, elsewhere
  - see "yarn run build" output
- check every old post
  - jquery in 2013 jump shot post
- social buttons in posts, like old post.html
- tag with sport and show icon somehow, like changelog?
- rss feed
- spider for 404s

about page with a bit more detail?
- link from zengm.com
- disclaimer from BBGM

pathPrefix and url filter to make all URLs point to zengm.com explicitly
- https://www.11ty.dev/docs/filters/url/
- detect /football/ and /basketball/ URLs?
- use in footer
- how to use in 11ty.js templates? this.url() should work, i think, see https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/javascript/ filters

sidebar menu
- use eleventyNavigation?
  - could also use that to replace the hacky parent system i built...

multiple sites
- https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/662
- https://www.11ty.dev/docs/pages-from-data/
  - data could just be the names of the sports, then whatever template language i use could do if/else inline
- or, use JS templates and write bySport/isSport equivalents

redirect basketball-gm.com/files and football-gm.com/files

eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight
- can't be used from JS template :(
