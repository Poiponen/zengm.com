<h3>My leagues are gone! What happened?</h3>
<p>Basketball GM stores all game data on your computer, in your browser profile. This means that you can't play one league on multiple devices unless you export it (from the Tools menu) and then create a new league with that file. So first, <b>make sure you're using the same browser on the same computer</b>.</p>
<p>If you are using the same browser on the same computer and your leagues are missing, the game data has probably been deleted. This can happen in places like schools and libraries that set browsers to automatically delete everything when they are closed. It also happens if you manually delete your browser data. For example, in Chrome, if you go to More tools > Clear browsing data... > Cookies and other site and plugin data, that will delete all your Basketball GM data. <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=340821">This is true even if you tell it to only delete data from today - if you played Basketball GM at all today, it will completely delete all your leagues.</a> Browsers may also delete data if disk space is running low, but I'm not sure if that ever actually happens.</p>
<p>In cases where the data has been deleted from your browser profile, the only way to get it back is if you have a backup. Sorry :(</p>

<h3>How can I play the same league on two computers?</h3>
<p>Currently there's no easy way to do this, but it is possible.</p>
<p>You can export a league (Tools > Export League), copy the file to your other computer, and then create a new league using that file.</p>

<h3>How do I make sure I'm running the latest version of the game?</h3>
<p>It should happen automatically, but sometimes shit happens, so if you want to be sure, follow the instructions at <a href="http://www.refreshyourcache.com/">RefreshYourCache.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Basketball GM 4 is too fast! How do I make it slow like it used to be?</h3>
<p>I agree, the performance of Basketball GM 4 is a marvel of modern engineering :)</p>
<p>I might add an option to slow it down at some point. But for now, you can try these ideas for slower play:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the league in multiple tabs. That'll slow it down. The more tabs you open, the slower it'll be.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t do "Play until playoffs" or "Play through playoffs". Instead, press alt+P to simulate one day at a time, at your own pace.</li>
</ul>
