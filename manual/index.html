<p>Basketball GM is a completely free sports management simulation game. You are the general manager of a basketball team, tasked with building your roster to compete for a championship while managing your finances. As of now, your goal can be whatever you want: winning the most championships, making the most profit, developing players from rookies to stars, etc. You can make an unlimited number of different leagues from <a href="https://play.basketball-gm.com/">the dashboard</a>, each one with a different set of random players.</p>
<h3>User Interface</h3>
<p>From within a league, the most important user interface element is the Play Menu, which you can access with the big blue Play button at the top of the screen. Any context-dependent action, like playing a game or moving from one phase to another, is done from the Play Menu. Everything else about the user interface should (hopefully) be self-explanitory.</p>
<h3>Gameplay Overview</h3>
<p>Each season of the game is divided into several phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Preseason.</b> Players develop/age (<i>i.e.</i> their ratings change). Young players tend to get better, old players tend to get worse.</li>
<li><b>Regular season.</b> Regular season games are played, at the pace you choose through the Play menu.</li>
<li><b>Playoffs.</b> Teams that made the playoffs (top 8 in each conference) progress through the bracket playing best-of-7 series until a champion emerges.</li>
<li><b>Draft lottery.</b> After the playoffs end, the draft order is set with a lottery.</li>
<li><b>Draft.</b> Similar to the NBA draft - other than a lottery for the first three picks of the first round, teams are ordered from worst to best for two rounds.</li>
<li><b>Re-sign players.</b> Before free agency starts, you get the opportunity to re-sign your players with expiring contracts.</li>
<li><b>Free agency.</b> Players who are not re-signed become free agents and teams can sign them.</li>
</ul>
<h3>League Rules</h3>
<p>League rules are generally similar on the NBA, but simplified.</p>
<h4>Salary cap</h4>
<p>The salary cap is $90 million. This is a soft cap, meaning that if you are over the salary cap, you can still:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draft players</li>
<li>Re-sign your current players (like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap#Larry_Bird_exception">Bird exception</a>)</li>
<li>Sign free agents to minimum contracts ($750k)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are above the "luxury tax limit" ($100M by default), you have to pay a luxury tax penalty equal to 150% of your excess spending. This is based on your actual spending, not just your payroll at the end of the year. So if you trade away a player with a big contract right at the end of the season, everything you paid him throughout the year still counts towards the salary cap.</p>
<p>There is also a minimum salary limit of $60 million. If you are below this limit, then you have to pay a penalty equal to the difference between your payroll and the limit.</p>
<h4>Contracts</h4>
<p>The maximum contract amount is $30 million per year and the maximum contract length is 5 years.</p>
<p>The minimum contract amount is $750 thousand per year and the minimum contract length is 1 year (or, until the end of the season, if the season is already in progress).</p>
<p>When a contract expires, you have the opportunity to negotiate a new contract with the player. If you don't come to an agreement, the player becomes a free agent. This is important because, based on the salary cap rules, you can go over the cap to re-sign your own players but you can't go over the cap to sign a free agent.</p>
<h3>Player Ratings</h3>
<p>Player ratings for a variety of categories (shooting, rebounding, passing, dribbling, etc.) are on a scale from 0-100. The whole scale is used, so a typical value for a rating is 50. Roughly, the overall ("ovr") player ratings mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>90s:</b> All-time great</li>
<li><b>80s:</b> MVP candidate</li>
<li><b>70s:</b> All League candidate</li>
<li><b>60s:</b> Good starter</li>
<li><b>50s:</b> Role player</li>
<li><b>40s and lower:</b> Bench</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the overall ratings aren't a guarantee of performance. The particular mix of ratings plays into success (<i>e.g.</i> a short player having a 100 shot blocking rating doesn't do much), as do a player's teammates (<i>e.g.</i> a good rebounder doesn't help your team as much if you already have a few other good rebounders).</p>
<p>The potential ("pot") rating is also important. This is an estimate of the player's future overall rating. Just like in real life, most players never reach their potential, but some do reach it and some even exceed it. (Potential is calculated by simulating career arcs for a player and picking the 75th percentile ovr, so ignoring the noise caused from small sample size, a player should exceed his pot 25% of the time.)</p>
<p>Also, you might notice that the height ("hgt") rating is not always proportional to the height in feet/inches of a player, because the hgt rating also includes wingspan and standing reach - basically how much a player's height/length impacts the game. The hgt rating is what's used in the simulations. The heights in feet/inches are just for show.</p>
<p>The displayed ratings are not the real ratings. They are estimates from your scouts. Increase the scouting budget to see more accurate ratings. This is a gradual effect over 3 seasons; you don't instantly see more accurate ratings by increasing spending.</p>
<p>Finally, little symbols you see next to a player's name like <span class="skills-alone"><span title="Three Point Shooter" class="skill">3</span><span title="Athlete" class="skill">A</span><span class="skill" title="Ball Handler">B</span><span title="Interior Defender" class="skill">Di</span><span class="skill" title="Perimeter Defender">Dp</span><span class="skill" title="Post Scorer">Po</span><span class="skill" title="Passer">Ps</span><span title="Rebounder" class="skill">R</span></span> represent the key skills a player has. This is designed so that you can just glance at a player and easily take in that information. It has no impact on gameplay. A player who barely misses getting a symbol will be about the same as a player who barely gets it.</p>
<p>To see what a symbol means, hover your mouse over it or consult this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>3: Three Point Shooter</li>
<li>A: Athlete</li>
<li>B: Ball Handler</li>
<li>Di: Interior Defender</li>
<li>Dp: Perimeter Defender</li>
<li>Po: Post Scorer</li>
<li>Ps: Passer</li>
<li>R: Rebounder</li>
</ul>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>There is no real way to "win" at Basketball GM. The game never ends. Your goal may be to win as many games as possible, or to make as much money as possible, or to draft a player and win him as many championships as possible, or anything else you can think of.</p>
<p>Regardless of your goal, you probably want to win some games. And there are also multiple ways to do that! Think of how NBA teams are run. Tanking is a viable strategy, but risky because your draft picks might be busts. Freeing up salary cap space to sign a big free agent can work, but if your team performance suffers too much, a star might not want to sign with you. Veterans can be available for cheap, but their abilities may decline rapidly. Ultimately, it's up to you to find the best strategy to meet your goals!</p>
<h3>Custom Rosters</h3>
<p>By default, all players are completely randomly generated. You can find some user made rosters on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2b9him/best_of_rbasketballgm/">Reddit</a>. You can also make your own: <a href="/manual/customization/">click here for more info about custom rosters.</a></p>
