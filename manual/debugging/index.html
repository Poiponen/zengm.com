  content: 'Kevin: Follow the instructions above to view errors in the JavaScript
    console and see if anything shows up. In the mean time, you can use another browser
    (IE10+, Firefox, or Chrome) and you should be able to start a new league there.'

<h3>Browser Compatibility</h3>
<p>Basketball GM only works in Chrome (any recent version) and Firefox (version 47 or higher). If you're already using one of those browsers and it's still not working, first make sure you're using the latest version. If you are, then continue reading...</p>
<h3>Debugging Info</h3>
<p>If you ran into a problem, <a href="/contact/">let us know so we can help you or try to fix the bug</a>. Please include as much detail as possible, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basketball GM version (at the bottom of the page when in the game)</li>
<li>browser version</li>
<li>operating system</li>
<li>specific steps one can take to reproduce your problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if you want to be extra helpful, try to report the specific error message that occurs. To do this, <a href="http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/q/8525">open the JavaScript console of your web browser</a> and see if any error message gets displayed there when you observe a bug. For example, if the draft won't start when you press the "Start Draft" button, then enable debug mode, open the JavaScript console, and try pressing it again. You will probably see an error message that will be very helpful to a developer trying to fix the bug.</p>
<p>If you're using Chrome, you can do even better. Copy chrome://inspect/#workers into the address bar and hit enter, click "Inspect" under https://play.basketball-gm.com/gen/worker.js and it will pop up another window where error messages might appear.</p>
