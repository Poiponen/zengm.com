<p>If Basketball GM is refusing to allow you to play more, it could be because of a quota error. This happens when your browser decides to not let you store any more data because it thinks you're running low on hard drive space.</p>
<p>Here are a few things you can try to fix the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete some old data from your leagues (Tools > Improve Performance within a league)</li>
<li>Delete some old leagues entirely</li>
<li>Delete some other files on your hard drive</li>
</ul>
<p>If none of that works, you can try a <a href="/manual/debugging/hard-reset/">Hard Reset</a> which will delete all your Basketball GM data and leave you with a completely blank slate. Sometimes this is the only way to get Chrome working again due to <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=488851">this bug</a>.</p>
<p>And if all else fails, you can try using another browser. <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/desktop/">Firefox</a> works best.</p>
<p>If you need help, <a href="/contact/">send an email or post to Reddit</a>.</p>
