Do you like text-based basketball simulation? Then you'll love the new text-based slam dunk contest in Basketball GM!

The All-Star Game has been in BBGM for a while. Now, before the All-Star Game is played, you can also simulate the slam dunk contest.

The slam dunk contest has no impact on any other part of your league. It's just a fun little mini-game. But honestly, it's pretty fun. I probably spent way too much time working on it, but the end result is that it has a ton of nice little features that I hope you enjoy!

But first, here's what it looks like:

There's a bunch of cool stuff you can see in that screenshot, and even more cool stuff that you can't. In no particular order:

- You can control contestants from your team, or all players in God Mode. So you get to customize your dunk and decide how crazy you want to make it, and you can see how that affects the projected score and the odds you actually make the dunk.

- You can the edit contestants before it starts in God Mode.

- The reigning winner is forced to compete every year, just for fun.

- Winning the slam dunk contest shows up as an award on player pages and the Awards Records page, including historical data for real players.

- The All-Star History page now links to past All-Star drafts.

- Scoring per dunk is 0-50 rather than 30-50 like the NBA, cause 30-50 is dumb.

- Dunkers are kind of smart. Like if someone is the last dunker in a round, they know how many points they need to advance, and they will try an easier/harder dunk than normal depending on that. You can see that in the first screenshot in this blog post - Cole White knew he needed a 50 to win, so he really went for it!

- Two of the dunk options are dunking over a tall person and a short person. For those dunks, it uses the tallest and shortest players currently in the league.
