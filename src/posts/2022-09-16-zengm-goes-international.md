I know there have been a lot of logo updates lately, but this one is especially exciting. [Elliott Strauss](https://www.estraussdesign.com/) is the designer who did most of the logos in my games, and he just finished a new batch of 10 teams. There are a few straggling North American cities, but it's mostly international.

You can use these teams in several ways. You can create a new custom league and click "Customize" next to the list of teams. You can go to Tools > Expansion Draft in an existing league and pick one of them as an expansion team. Or you can go to Tools > Manage Teams and relocate an existing franchise to one of these cities.

Or play [ZenGM Hockey](https://hockey.zengm.com/) where Edmonton, New Jersey, and Winnipeg are in new leagues by default.

        <p>Edmonton famously has <a href="https://www.edmonton.ca/residential_neighbourhoods/pets_wildlife/rats">no rats</a>, but it does have muskrats, also known as river rats.</p>

        <h4>Manila Monkey-Eating Eagles</h4>
        <p>It's another name for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_eagle">Philippine eagle</a> which is a really cool looking bird. But given some of the creative team names in the Philippine Basketball Association, I think "Monkey-Eating Eagles" sounds better than just "Eagles".</p>
