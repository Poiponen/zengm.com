New feature in version 2021.05.31.0967 - players can now play through minor injuries.

You can control what your team does with these new sliders on the roster page:

There are separate sliders for the regular season and playoffs because there is risk involved in playing through injuries. The injury rate is 50% higher when playing through an injury, which includes the possibility of a player either reaggrivating his current injury or getting a new injury.

Additionally, the earlier a player comes back, the worse he will play. "90% performance" means a 70 ovr player will perform more like a 63 ovr player.

In box scores, a yellow injury icon means a player is playing through an injury:

In a live sim, if that yellow icon switches to red, that means the player was injured again and will miss at least the rest of the game.

One other injury-related change... last year, I decreased the duration of injuries in the playoffs because it was really annoying to see your star sit out with a minor injury. Now that players can play through injuries, I got rid of that adjustment. Playoff injuries are now the same as regular season injuries.
