One of the most common feature requests has been to add an All-Star Game. I was always kind of reluctant to do it, both because it'd be a little messy to implement and because the All-Star Game doesn't actually _matter_, right? It's just a diversion. It's just, you know, fun. Like a video game is supposed to be. Yes, even a text-based simulator like Basketball GM still needs to be fun. So now there is a nice fun All-Star Game. [Go play now](https://play.basketball-gm.com/) to see it for yourself, or read on for details.

At the beginning of the regular season phase, when the schedule is being generated, an All-Star Game will be scheduled 60% of the way through the season. For leagues with in-progress seasons, you'll have to wait until next season.

When an All-Star Game is scheduled, there will be a new entry in the Play menu, "Until All-Star Game". You can simply ignore it and keep playing as you did in the past, and all the All-Star stuff will happen in the background. Or you can simulate until the All-Star Game.

If the next game in the schedule is the All-Star Game, yet another new entry appears in the Play menu: "View All-Star draft". Again, you can simply ignore this and keep playing. But it's pretty fun. If you click it, you're taken to the All-Star draft, which works similar to the NBA's All-Star draft. The top two players are captains, and they select from a pool of 22 other top players. All-Stars are selected based on which players have the highest EWA+WS values. Unlike the NBA, conferences don't matter. If any All-Stars are injured, replacements will be selected. The injured players still get credit for being All-Stars, they just don't get to play in the game.

If a player from your team is selected as a captain, then something fun happens. You get to draft the team for him. I know this is silly and unrealistic, but it's also fun!

After the draft, the actual game occurs. Like a normal game, you can either watch it live or simulate it and view the completed box score. The box score is available by going to Stats > Game Log and switching the team to "All-Star Game", or by going to League > History > All-Star History.

The All-Star Game has a few differences relative to a normal game:

1. Faster pace
2. Less defense
3. Fewer injuries
4. No home court advantage

The end result is a lot of scoring!

After the game is over, an MVP is selected. The MVP is displayed below the box score.

All-Star selections and MVPs show up as awards in the places you'd expect: the event log, player pages, and the Awards Records page. There is also the aforementioned All-Star History page (linked from League > History), which shows the result of every past All-Star game along with the captains and MVP.

If all this sounds horrifying to you, there is also a God Mode option to disable the All-Star game completely.

This is just the beginning! Eventually there will be even more All-Star features. Imagine text-based slam dunk and three point shooting contests, those would be fun.

And this is all only in Basketball GM, not [Football GM](/football/), because an All-Star Game is both more complicated and less important in football. I hope to bring it to Football GM in the future.
