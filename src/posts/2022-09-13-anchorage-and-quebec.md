Like the recent Oakland and Albuquerque logos, the Quebec logo was made by BigBlue642#4640 from Discord, based on [the coat of arms for Quebec City](https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Armoiries_de_la_Ville_de_Qu%C3%A9bec.jpg). The Anchorage logo was sent in by mamamia5x aka Bugs Bunny over on [GitHub](https://github.com/zengm-games/zengm/pull/429), inspired in part by the other logos that have been added recently.

If there are any other aspiring logo designers out there, feel free to give it a try! If you make a good logo for a decent sized city, I'll probably include it in the game. The only technical constraints are that it should be in SVG format and it should look good at the resolutions used in game (roughly 256x256 for the big one and 32x32 for the small one). If you have something you want to share, [please do](/contact/)!
