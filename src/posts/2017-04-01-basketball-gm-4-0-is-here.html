<p>This is not an April Fool's Day joke! Basketball GM 4.0 is really here, and it's awesome. For those who haven't been following along, here are the biggest changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The game runs ridiculously faster than it used to.</li>
<li>It's so fast that it's actually playable on phones and tablets (iPhone/iPad support is pretty flaky still, but should improve in the near future).</li>
<li>You can <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Afr3i4X.png">easily apply complex filters to tables</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll make another post with more technical details soon, for those who are interested in such things.</p>
