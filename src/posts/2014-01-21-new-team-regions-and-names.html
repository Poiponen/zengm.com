<p>As I described in <a href="http://basketball-gm.com/blog/2014/01/the-great-realignment/">my previous post</a>, Basketball GM needed some new cities and team names. Thanks to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1vjlcu/the_great_realignment_help_pick_new_team_names/">your great suggestions</a>, we narrowed it down to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1voggc/survey_basketball_gm_is_renaming_its_teams_vote/">a short survey</a> that got over 100 responses (thank you to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/featherfooted">featherfooted</a> for setting it up). You can view the final survey results <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hGkGrj8OdFQ3m2MHatRbe97lCy2kJbxddO44WRAloBY/viewanalytics">here</a>.</p>

<p>However, as the commissioner of the league, I decided to make a few minor executive decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voters picked the New York Skyline over the Bankers by just one vote, but I went with Bankers because I like it a lot better.</li>
<li>Voters picked the Atlanta Peaches over the Gold Club by just five votes, but I went with <a href="http://espn.go.com/page2/s/simmons/010810.html">Gold Club</a> because I like it a lot better.</li>
<li>Voters picked the San Francisco Hippies over the Entrepreneurs or the Venture Capitalists, but I think that was mainly because the latter two options are similar and they split the vote. So I went with Venture Capitalists (even though it's kind of too long).</li>
<li>Voters picked Symphonies for the name of the Seattle team, but I changed it to Symphony because I think the singular form sounds better.</li>
</ul>
<p>In total, that leaves these new teams:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Atlantic:</b> Boston Massacre, Montreal Mounties, New York City Bankers, Philadelphia Cheesesteaks, Toronto Beavers</li>
<li><b>Central:</b> Chicago Whirlwinds, Cincinnati Riots, Cleveland Curses, Detroit Muscle, Pittsburgh Rivers</li>
<li><b>Southeast:</b> Atlanta Gold Club, Baltimore Crabs, Miami Cyclones, Tampa Turtles, Washington Monuments</li>
<li><b>Southwest:</b> Dallas Snipers, Houston Apollos, Mexico City Aztecs, Phoenix Vultures, St. Louis Spirits</li>
<li><b>Northwest:</b> Denver High, Minneapolis Blizzards, Portland Roses, Seattle Symphony, Vancouver Whalers</li>
<li><b>Pacific:</b> Las Vegas Blue Chips, Los Angeles Earthquakes, Sacramento Gold Rush, San Diego Pandas, San Francisco Venture Capitalists</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you ridicule my abuse of power, I should say that I also wanted to pick the Boston Three Party and Toronto Cosmopolitans, but they didn't even come close to winning and I couldn't bring myself to so blatantly rig the outcome.</p>
<p>The new team names are live now (only in new leagues). Please let me know if there are any problems. Thank you!</p>
