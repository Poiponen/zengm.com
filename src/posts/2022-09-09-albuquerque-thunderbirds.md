There's a new team in the ZenGM universe, the Albuquerque Thunderbirds!

Like the recent Oakland Blue Oaks logo, this one was made by BigBlue642#4640 from Discord. The Thunderbird is a legendary creature for some indigenous peoples, and the logo also has elements from [official flag of Albuquerque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Albuquerque,_New_Mexico.svg) (which itself includes a thunderbird).

If there are any other aspiring logo designers out there, feel free to give it a try! If you make a good logo for a decent sized city, I'll probably include it in the game. The only technical constraints are that it should be in SVG format and it should look good at the resolutions used in game (roughly 256x256 for the big one and 32x32 for the small one). If you have something you want to share, [please do](/contact/)!
