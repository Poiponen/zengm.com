<p>Thanks you everyone for testing the first beta! All of the bugs people found have been fixed. The biggest change from the first beta is that multi-tab play is back. There are two caveats. First, you can only have one league open at a time. I figure this is not a huge problem, but let me know if you often do have multiple leagues open. Second, it is a little slower than the first beta, but still much faster than it used to be.</p>
<p>Also, multi-tab play does not work in Safari, so you can either play one tab per league in Safari or use another browser.</p>
<p>With that being said, <a href="https://beta.basketball-gm.com/">here's the link to beta 2</a>, please give it a try. To make sure you're on beta 2 and not the original beta, look at the bottom of the page. It should have a date of 2017.03.24.1059 or later.</p>
<p>Like last time... this is a beta, so bang on it, try to break it, try to get it to produce an error. Feedback is appreciated, on <a href="/discord/">Discord</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/61bwl9/basketball_gm_40_beta_2/">Reddit</a>.</p>
