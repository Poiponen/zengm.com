<p>If you've been here a while, you may recall that Basketball GM used to be open source. Last year, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1sarll/open_source/">I closed the source</a> for various reasons. Now, I'm semi-opening it back up. My goal is to allow others to contribute to the development of Basketball GM without allowing a competitor to swoop in and just clone everything. I hope it works.</p>
<p>So please, <a href="https://github.com/zengm-games/zengm">take a look at the code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zengm-games/zengm/blob/master/LICENSE.md">read the license</a>. If everything looks enticing and you want to help make Basketball GM better, please get in touch! There are tons and tons of ways Basketball GM could be improved, in many different areas.</p>
