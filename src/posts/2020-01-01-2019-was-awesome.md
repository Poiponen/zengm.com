Happy New Year!

2019 was a great year for Basketball GM. The game is better than ever. Well of course I'm a biased source, but it's not just me saying that. The stats speak for themselves.

2019 set new records in all those categories! The last column is the craziest... you guys collectively spent over 136 years playing Basketball GM in 2019. A less impressive way of saying the same thing is that, at any given time during the year, there were on average 136 people playing Basketball GM.
