Happy New Year!

2019 was a great year for Basketball GM. The game is better than ever. Well of course I'm a biased source, but it's not just me saying that. The stats speak for themselves.

<div class="table-responsive">

| Year | Sessions  | Pageviews   | Total Play Time (years) |
| ---- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| 2013 | 135,664   | 13,661,063  | 18.14                   |
| 2014 | 471,553   | 39,662,532  | 42.06                   |
| 2015 | 982,926   | 76,650,999  | 66.73                   |
| 2016 | 1,101,256 | 86,009,829  | 70.09                   |
| 2017 | 1,657,749 | 144,489,273 | 86.79                   |
| 2018 | 1,868,091 | 184,571,462 | 100.70                  |
| 2019 | 2,403,039 | 222,568,917 | 136.32                  |

</div>

2019 set new records in all those categories! The last column is the craziest... you guys collectively spent over 136 years playing Basketball GM in 2019. A less impressive way of saying the same thing is that, at any given time during the year, there were on average 136 people playing Basketball GM.
