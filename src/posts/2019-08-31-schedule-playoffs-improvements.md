I deployed two changes today in version 2019.08.31.0916.

1. The regular season schedule is more balanced. All teams will play an equal number of home and away games, and all teams will have one home game and one away game with each other team in their division.

2. Division winners are guaranteed a top 4 seed in the playoffs, even if they have a worse record than some non division winners.

As always, [let me know](/contact/) if you notice any problems!
