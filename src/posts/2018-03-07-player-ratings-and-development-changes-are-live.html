<p>A lot of things have changed! If you want all the details, <a href="/blog/2018/02/player-ratings-and-development-beta/">read the blog post announcing the beta</a>. But the main points are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two new ratings offensive IQ (OIQ) and defensive IQ (DIQ), which replace the old BLK and STL ratings.</li>
<li>Potential (POT) has been redefined so it is much more accurate and realistic.</li>
<li>There are more statistical outliers, particularly as you play many seasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you to everyone who helped beta test these changes. You helped me improve it a lot from the initial beta. However, I know it's not perfect now. Why not? Because it's hard! Even if someone correctly notices an issue, it's difficult to fix it because everything is interconnected. Fix X, break Y and Z. So it's not perfect now, but it's pretty good I think. As always, please let me know if you disagree!</p>
